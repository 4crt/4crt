# Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my GitHub!

I'm an IT enthusiast with a strong passion for all things tech. I love diving into new tools and methodologies, always on the lookout for ways to optimize and improve processes.

## About Me ðŸŒ±

Currently, I'm a **DevOps Engineer** at Endava, where I work with tools like **Terraform**, **Ansible**, and **Jenkins** to build and maintain scalable environments. I'm always exploring new technologies like **NixOS** and frameworks like **Django**. Recently, I made the switch back to **QWERTY** from Dvorak to better collaborate with my team.
